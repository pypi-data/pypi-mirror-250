# RL_MGM (reinforcement learning micro-gird managers) Module:
> A set of modules that can be used to aid in simulating a micro-grid environment for training reinforcement learning based energy management policy generators. The two main modules are the _DATAGENERATORS and MG_Managers. They are described in the [General information](#general-info) section below.

## General Info
> This rl-migrogrid-mangers (reinforcement learning) module contains a set of submodules that define RL networks for use as energy management agents, tools to generate hourly building load and various MW sizes of PV output based on the month and hour based on fitted distributions. The modules can be defined as follows:
### * _DATAGENERATORS: set of tools to create stochastic data generators that represent hourly load profiles and month/hour PV MW outputs. 
### * _MG_Managers: set of RL networks that can be trained on simulated microgrid data to generate energy management policies.
