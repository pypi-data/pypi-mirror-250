# Purpose: Tools to generate data from some distribution. Classes for
#          generating demand data for a given building type, and time 
#          of day are defined. In addition a class for generating PV 
#          energy outputs are defined. Lastly, a stored instances of python objects 
#          for generating demand and PV data are created and stored as variables.
