# **Use _Activation Intervention_ to Interpret _Causal Mechanism_ of Model**
**pyvene** supports customizable interventions on different neural architectures (e.g., RNN or Transformers). It supports complex intervention schemas (e.g., parallel or serialized interventions) and a wide range of intervention modes (e.g., static or trained interventions) at scale to gain interpretability insights.

**Getting Started:** [<img align="center" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" />](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/pyvene/blob/main/tutorials/basic_tutorials/Basic_Intervention.ipynb) [**_pyvene_ 101**]  

## Installation
```bash
pip install pyvene
```

## _Wrap_ , _Intervene_ and _Share_
You can intervene with supported models as,
```python
import pyvene
from pyvene import IntervenableRepresentationConfig, IntervenableConfig, IntervenableModel

# provided wrapper for huggingface gpt2 model
_, tokenizer, gpt2 = pyvene.create_gpt2()

# turn gpt2 into intervenable_gpt2
intervenable_gpt2 = IntervenableModel(
    intervenable_config = IntervenableConfig(
        intervenable_representations=[
            IntervenableRepresentationConfig(
                0,            # intervening layer 0
                "mlp_output", # intervening mlp output
                "pos",        # intervening based on positional indices of tokens
                1             # maximally intervening one token
            ),
        ],
    ), 
    model = gpt2
)

# intervene base with sources on the fourth token.
original_outputs, intervened_outputs = intervenable_gpt2(
    tokenizer("The capital of Spain is", return_tensors="pt"),
    [tokenizer("The capital of Italy is", return_tensors="pt")],
    {"sources->base": ([[[4]]], [[[4]]])}
)
original_outputs.last_hidden_state - intervened_outputs.last_hidden_state
```
which returns,

```
tensor([[[ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
         [ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
         [ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
         [ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
         [ 0.0008, -0.0078, -0.0066,  ...,  0.0007, -0.0018,  0.0060]]])
```
showing that we have causal effects only on the last token as expected. You can share your interventions through Huggingface with others with a single call,
```python
intervenable_gpt2.save(
    save_directory="./your_gpt2_mounting_point/",
    save_to_hf_hub=True,
    hf_repo_name="your_gpt2_mounting_point",
)
```
We see interventions are knobs that can mount on models. And people can share their knobs with others to share knowledge about how to steer models.

You can also use the `intervenable_gpt2` just like a regular torch model component inside another model, or another pipeline as,
```py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple, Union, Dict

class ModelWithIntervenables(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelWithIntervenables, self).__init__()
        self.intervenable_gpt2 = intervenable_gpt2
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(768, 1)
        # Your other downstream components go here

    def forward(
        self, 
        base,
        sources: Optional[List] = None,
        unit_locations: Optional[Dict] = None,
        activations_sources: Optional[Dict] = None,
        subspaces: Optional[List] = None,
    ):
        _, counterfactual_x = self.intervenable_gpt2(
            base,
            sources,
            unit_locations,
            activations_sources,
            subspaces
        )
        counterfactual_x = counterfactual_x.last_hidden_state
        
        counterfactual_x = self.relu(counterfactual_x)
        counterfactual_x = self.fc(counterfactual_x)
        return counterfactual_x
```

## Causal Abstraction: From Interventions to Gain Interpretability Insights
Basic interventions are fun but we cannot make any causal claim systematically. To gain actual interpretability insights, we want to measure the counterfactual behaviors of a model in a data-driven fashion. In other words, if the model responds systematically to your interventions, then you start to associate certain regions in the network with a high-level concept. We also call this alignment search process with model internals.

### Understanding Causal Mechanisms with Static Interventions
Here is a more concrete example,
```py
def add_three_numbers(a, b, c):
    var_x = a + b
    return var_x + c
```
The function solves a 3-digit sum problem. Let's say, we trained a neural network to solve this problem perfectly. "Can we find the representation of (a + b) in the neural network?". We can use this library to answer this question. Specifically, we can do the following,

- **Step 1:** Form Interpretability (Alignment) Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a set of neurons N aligns with (a + b).
- **Step 2:** Counterfactual Testings: If our hypothesis is correct, then swapping neurons N between examples would give us expected counterfactual behaviors. For instance, the values of N for (1+2)+3, when swapping with N for (2+3)+4, the output should be (2+3)+3 or (1+2)+4 depending on the direction of the swap.
- **Step 3:** Reject Sampling of Hypothesis: Running tests multiple times and aggregating statistics in terms of counterfactual behavior matching. Proposing a new hypothesis based on the results. 

To translate the above steps into API calls with the library, it will be a single call,
```py
intervenable.evaluate(
    train_dataloader=test_dataloader,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    inputs_collator=inputs_collator
)
```
where you provide testing data (basically interventional data and the counterfactual behavior you are looking for) along with your metrics functions. The library will try to evaluate the alignment with the intervention you specified in the config.

--- 

### Understanding Causal Mechanism with Trainable Interventions
The alignment searching process outlined above can be tedious when your neural network is large. For a single hypothesized alignment, you basically need to set up different intervention configs targeting different layers and positions to verify your hypothesis. Instead of doing this brute-force search process, you can turn it into an optimization problem which also has other benefits such as distributed alignments.

In its crux, we basically want to train an intervention to have our desired counterfactual behaviors in mind. And if we can indeed train such interventions, we claim that causally informative information should live in the intervening representations! Below, we show one type of trainable intervention `models.interventions.RotatedSpaceIntervention` as,
```py
class RotatedSpaceIntervention(TrainableIntervention):
    
    """Intervention in the rotated space."""
    def forward(self, base, source):
        rotated_base = self.rotate_layer(base)
        rotated_source = self.rotate_layer(source)
        # interchange
        rotated_base[:self.interchange_dim] = rotated_source[:self.interchange_dim]
        # inverse base
        output = torch.matmul(rotated_base, self.rotate_layer.weight.T)
        return output
```
Instead of activation swapping in the original representation space, we first **rotate** them, and then do the swap followed by un-rotating the intervened representation. Additionally, we try to use SGD to **learn a rotation** that lets us produce expected counterfactual behavior. If we can find such rotation, we claim there is an alignment. `If the cost is between X and Y.ipynb` tutorial covers this with an advanced version of distributed alignment search, [Boundless DAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08809). There are [recent works](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RFtkRXHebkwxygDe2/an-interpretability-illusion-for-activation-patching-of) outlining potential limitations of doing a distributed alignment search as well.

You can now also make a single API call to train your intervention,
```py
intervenable.train(
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    compute_loss=compute_loss,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    inputs_collator=inputs_collator
)
```
where you need to pass in a trainable dataset, and your customized loss and metrics function. The trainable interventions can later be saved on to your disk. You can also use `intervenable.evaluate()` your interventions in terms of customized objectives.
