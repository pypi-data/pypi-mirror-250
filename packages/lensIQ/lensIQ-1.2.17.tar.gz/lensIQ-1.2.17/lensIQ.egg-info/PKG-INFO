# Theia Technologies IQSmart(R)
[Theia Technologies](https://www.theiatech.com) offers a [MCR600 motor control board](https://www.theiatech.com/lenses/accessories/mcr/) for interfacing with Theia's motorized lenses.  This board controls focus, zoom, iris, and IRC filter motors.  It can be connected to a host comptuer by USB, UART, or I2C connection.  This IQSmart module allows the user to easily convert from engineering units (meters, degrees) to motor steps applicable to Theia's motorized lenses.  For sending these motor steps to the contorl board to move the lens, install TheiaMCR ([TheiaMCR on Github](https://github.com/cliquot22/TheiaMCR))

# Features
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="20" height="20"/> Engineering units can be converted to motor steps and vice versa.  The calculations use the design data for the lens but it is possible to load a calibration data file as well.
