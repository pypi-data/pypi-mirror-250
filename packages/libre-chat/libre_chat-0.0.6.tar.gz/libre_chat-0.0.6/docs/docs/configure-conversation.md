Create a `chat.yml` file with your configuration before starting the web service.

Below is an example of configuration using the Mixtral GGUF model, without vectorstore, to deploy a **generic conversational chatbot**

```yaml title="chat.yml"
llm:
  model_path: ./models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q2_K.gguf # (1)
  model_download: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/resolve/main/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q2_K.gguf
  temperature: 0.01    # Config how creative, but also potentially wrong, the model can be. 0 is safe, 1 is adventurous
  max_new_tokens: 1024 # Max number of words the LLM can generate

prompt:
  # Always use input for the human input variable with a generic agent
  variables: [input, history]
