# Code Interpreter

In this example we demonstrate BondAI's ability to combine online research and data visualization tasks. We ask BondAI to plot a line chart of U.S. GDP between 2000 and 2010, which requires using a combination of web search, data extraction and data visualization tools (ie matplotlib).

First we will configure the environment variables for OpenAI and Google Search.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXX
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX
export GOOGLE_CSE_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
```

Next we will create an Agent with 3 tools:
- **GoogleSearchTool** allows the Agent to search the internet.
- **WebsiteQueryTool** allows the Agent to query information about websites. Note that this tool has integrated semantic search. If the content of the website exceeds the LLM's context window size BondAI will automatically convert the content to Embeddings and semantically filter it to fit inside the context window.
- **PythonREPLTool** allows the Agent run Python scripts.

```python
from bondai.agents import Agent
from bondai.tools import PythonREPLTool
from bondai.tools.search import GoogleSearchTool
from bondai.tools.website import WebsiteQueryTool

task = "I want you to generate a line chart of the U.S. GDP from 2000 to 2010."

Agent(tools=[
  GoogleSearchTool(),
  WebsiteQueryTool(),
  PythonREPLTool()
]).run(task)
```

## Example Output
