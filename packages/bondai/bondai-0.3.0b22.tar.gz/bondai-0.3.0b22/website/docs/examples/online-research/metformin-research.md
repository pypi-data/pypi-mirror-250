# Metformin and Aging

## Summary of Findings

Metformin, a drug commonly used to treat diabetes, has been studied for its potential applications in the prevention and treatment of aging and aging-related diseases. These include:

- Delaying aging and extending lifespan
- Treating degenerative musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and intervertebral disc degeneration
- Protecting against cardiovascular diseases
- Potentially improving neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease
- Potentially reducing the risk and improving outcomes in various types of cancer
- Treating obesity and other metabolic abnormalities
- Treating other diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and COVID-19

However, the effectiveness of Metformin in treating aging-related diseases is still being studied. While observational studies suggest that Metformin may reduce the incidence of aging-related diseases such as neurodegenerative disease and cancer in humans, more research is needed to fully understand its effects. Clinical trials, such as the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial, are currently underway to evaluate the potential benefits of Metformin in extending human longevity and reducing aging-related morbidity.

## Recommendation for a 43-Year-Old Male

For a 43-year-old male who is in good health and exercises regularly, the potential benefits of Metformin include reducing the risk of aging-related diseases such as neurodegenerative disease and cancer, as well as potentially extending lifespan and promoting healthy aging. However, it is important to note that the effects of Metformin can vary among individuals, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects on aging in humans.

## Risks and Tradeoffs

The common side effects of Metformin include feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhea, stomach ache, loss of appetite, and a metallic taste in the mouth. It can also cause vitamin B12 deficiency and low blood sugar when taken with other diabetes medicines. Serious side effects are rare but may include severe tiredness, liver problems, and a serious allergic reaction. Immediate medical attention is required if there are symptoms such as swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing, skin turning blue or pale, confusion, or fainting. Long-term use of Metformin can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency.
