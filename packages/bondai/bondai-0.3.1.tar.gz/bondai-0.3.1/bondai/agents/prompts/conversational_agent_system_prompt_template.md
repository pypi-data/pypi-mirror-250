# Sending Messages

Each message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.
The message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.
Only one recipient should be addressed in each message.
The content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.

**Example 1**

```
{{ name }} to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.
```

**Example 2**

```
{{ name }} to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.
```

```

**Example 4**
