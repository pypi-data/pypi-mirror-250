# Command Line Interface

BondAI comes with an easy to use Command Line Interface for an "out of the box" Agent experience that includes a number of default tools.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Installing BondAI is easy:

```bash
pip install bondai
```

Once you've installed BondAI the CLI will be available as an executable in your shell. Before running the CLI you will need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXX
```

When you start BondAI the Task Assistant Agent will ask you about the task you want to run and gather any necessary details. To start the CLI just run `bondai` in your shell.

```bash wordWrap=true
% bondai

## CLI Default Tools

When starting the CLI, BondAI will load the following tools by default.

- **DalleTool** - Allows BondAI to generate images using the Dalle-E text to image model.
- **ImageAnalysisTool** - Allows the Agent to use GPT4 Vision to analyze images.
- **DuckDuckGoSearchTool** - This is the default search tool loaded by BondAI as it requires no API keys or additional configuration.
- **WebsiteQueryTool** - Allows the Agent to query information about websites. Note that this tool has integrated semantic search. If the content of the website exceeds the LLM's context window size BondAI will automatically convert the content to Embeddings and semantically filter it to fit inside the context window.
- **FileQueryTool** - Allows BondAI to query file contents. Note that this tool has integrated semantic search. If the content of the file exceeds the LLM's context window size BondAI will automatically convert the content to Embeddings and semantically filter it to fit inside the context window.
- **DownloadFileTool** - Allows BondAI to download files from the internet and save them to local files.
- **FileWriteTool** - Allows BondAI to save text to a local file.
- **PythonREPLTool** - Allows the Agent run Python scripts.
- **ShellTool** - Allows the Agent access to the shell.

```

## CLI Command Line Arguments

The following command line arguments can be specified to change the CLI behavior. For example:
```bash
bondai --enable-prompt-logging --quiet
```

- **--server [PORT]** - Starts the BondAI API server. Learn more about the [BondAI API here](./category/api-specification).
- **--enable-prompt-logging [LOG_DIR]** - Turns on prompt logging which will write all prompt inputs into the specified directory. If no directory is provided BondAI will default to saving logs within the current directory.
- **--quiet** - Suppress agent output. Unless specified the agent will print detailed information about each step it's taking and the tools it's using.
