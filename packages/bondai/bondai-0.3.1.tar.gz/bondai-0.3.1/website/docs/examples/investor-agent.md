# Investor Agent

In this example we demonstrate BondAI's ability to use the Alpaca Market APIs to buy and sell stocks. Note that it is highly recommended that you use [Paper Trading](https://alpaca.markets/docs/trading/paper-trading/) for this example.

First we will configure the environment variables for OpenAI and Alpaca Markets.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXX
export ALPACA_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX
export ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX
```

Next we will create an Agent with 2 tools:
- **CreateOrderTool** allows the Agent to create buy and sell orders.
- **ListPositionsTool** allows the Agent to pull a list of the user's current positions.

```python
from bondai.agents import Agent
from bondai.tools.alpaca_markets import CreateOrderTool, GetAccountTool, ListPositionsTool

task = "Sell off all my current positions and buy 10 shares of Nvidia."

Agent(tools=[
  CreateOrderTool(),
  ListPositionsTool()
]).run(task)
```
