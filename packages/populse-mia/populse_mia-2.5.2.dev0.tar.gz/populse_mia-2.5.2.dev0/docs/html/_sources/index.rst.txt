Generalities
============

MIA is shorthand for "Multiparametric Image Analysis". It is intended to be a complete image processing environment mainly targeted at the analysis and visualization of large amounts of MRI data.

MRI data analysis often requires a complex succession of data processing pipelines applied to a set of data acquired in an MRI exam or over several MRI exams. This analysis may need to be repeated a large number of times in studies involving a large number of acquisition sessions. Such that manual execution of the processing modules or simple ad-hoc scripting of the process may become error-prone, cumbersome and difficult to reproduce. Data processing pipelines exist in separate heterogeneous toolboxes, developed in-house or by other researchers in the field. This heterogeneity adds to the complexity of the modules are to be invoked manually.

Populse_MIA aims to provide easy tools to perform complex data processing based on a definition of the inputs and outputs of the individual pipelines on a conceptual level, and implies identifying data with respect to their role in an analysis project: "the scan type", "the subject being scanned", "the group of this subject is part of", etc.
