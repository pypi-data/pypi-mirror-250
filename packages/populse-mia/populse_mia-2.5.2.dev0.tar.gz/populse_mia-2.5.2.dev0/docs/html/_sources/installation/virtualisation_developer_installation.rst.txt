Mia's developer installation - Using virtualization
===================================================

The general installation process is to first, thanks to virtualization, make running BrainVisa on your system (see :ref:`prerequirements_2`).
Then, the installation will be almost identical to the one done directly on the host (see :ref:`installation_2`).

You can perform the installation by following the detailed instruction provided by `BrainVisa team (Developer environment installation section) <https://brainvisa.info/web/download.html#developer-environment-installation>`_.
In this case, skip the :ref:`prerequirements_2` below and proceed directly to the :ref:`installation_2`.
Depending on the solution you have chosen, go to the Singularity container or the VirtualBox virtual machine and then follow the :ref:`installation_2` section below.
For developer, it is recommended to use the Brainvisa developer image (casa_dev) in order to get the last version available of each project used in populse.

You can also follow the full procedure below which uses Singularity virtualization technology.

.. _prerequirements_2:

Pre-requirements
----------------

* `For linux <./virtualisation_pre_req_linux_developer.html>`_

* For macos, please follow the detailed instruction provided by `BrainVisa team (Developer environment installation section) <https://brainvisa.info/web/download.html#developer-environment-installation>`_.

* For Windows 10, please follow the detailed instruction provided by `BrainVisa team (Developer environment installation section) <https://brainvisa.info/web/download.html#developer-environment-installation>`_.

.. _installation_2:

Installation
------------

* If you followed `BrainVisa installation <https://brainvisa.info/web/download.html>`_ you should be in the container. Make sure to type the command ``bv bash`` if not.

* Inside the container, get the sources code by following the instructions detailed in the `installation part on host <./host_developer_installation.html#installation>`_. As capsul, populse_db, soma-base and soma-workflow are already in the Brainvisa developer image, it is not necessary to clone these projects.
