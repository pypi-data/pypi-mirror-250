selecta - Interactively search and select entries from your bash/zsh history.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Python package](https://github.com/vindolin/selecta/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/vindolin/selecta/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

This is a Python3 clone of François Fleuret's excellent [selector](https://fleuret.org/cgi-bin/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=selector.git;a=summary) tool.

Usage
=====
Just type some characters and see which entries match your words.

You can search for whole sentences by prefixing your search with a double quote.

Use <kbd>up</kbd> and <kbd>down</kbd> arrows to navigate the list.

<kbd>Escape</kbd>/<kbd>Backspace</kbd> on the result list returns to the search input.

<kbd>Escape</kbd> on the search input closes selecta.

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to copy the selected entry to the console.

<kbd>CTRL+a</kbd> toggles case sensitivity

<kbd>CTRL+r</kbd> toggles regex search

Installation
============

```console
pip install selecta
```
Install the keyboard shortcut ALT+{key}:

```console
selecta_add_keybinding {the alt key you want to use}
```

This will append one of the following lines to your ~/.bashrc/zshrc:

```console
bind -x '"\C-[{key}":"\selecta --bash -y <(history)"'
bindkey -s "^[{key}" "selecta --zsh -y <(history)^M"
```

Upgrade from older version to 0.2.x
-----------------------------------
Delete your old keybinding from .bashrc/.zshrc and register the new version with:
```console
selecta_add_keybinding
```
