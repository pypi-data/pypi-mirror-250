# Shining-Brain: Data Analysis Tools

Shining-Brain is a powerful data analysis toolkit designed to streamline the process of working with CSV and Excel files and integrating them with MySQL. With Shining-Brain, you can effortlessly generate Data Definition Language (DDL) from CSV or Excel files and load data from both CSV and Excel files directly into MySQL databases. You can also gather the file paths by giving a directory.

## Features

### Generate DDL from CSV or Excel File

With Shining-Brain, you can convert your CSV or Excel files into MySQL Data Definition Lanagues (DDL), allowing you to create database tables that match the structure of your data quickly.

### Generate Column Mapping from CSV or Excel File

You can check the column mapping to decide where to use it or update your original file.

### Load CSV and Excel into MySQL

Shining-Brain simplifies the process of loading data from CSV and Excel files into MySQL. Where you're importing large datasets or working with complex data structures, Shining-Brain handles the process seamlessly.

### Gather File Paths

}
table_name = 'your_table_name'

load_file_into_database(filename, table_name, column_mapping)
