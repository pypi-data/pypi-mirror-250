"""
dpg11_pylib

A collection of Python modules for working with the WavePond DPG11 Data Generator. This also should work with
the DAx22000, DAx12000, and DAx14000 series of data generators from WavePond, however I have not tested this.

This package is not supported by WavePond, and is not an official WavePond product. This was writtend for use
in Kai-Mei Fu's lab at the University of Washington.
