### WITCH v1.0.3
1. Fixed an oversight in memory issue if the backbone alignment is large and
we are creating a lot of subsets (`gcmm/algorithm.py`).
2. Added default behavior to function `gcmm/task.py/handleFuture(...)` so that
return values are attached to `success` if no callback function is provided.
3. Moving towards using my generic task manager for all parallelization.

### WITCH v1.0.2
1. Added an option to bypass the initial config setup step. Use `-y`, or
`--bypass-setup` in your commandline running WITCH to avoid being asked where
to generate the config directory (will default to `~/.witch_msa`). Example:
running `witch.py -y -i [sequence files]` for the first time will directly set
up WITCH configuration file and start aligning the input sequences.

### WITCH v1.0.2a1
1. Fixed not using absolute path when setting up the directory for `main.config`.
2. Improved metavar naming for argument parameters.
3. Fixed a bug in the included MAGUS installation such that if the user has 
a file or directory named `fasttree/` in the folder where WITCH is run, MAGUS
will try to read it as the guide tree instead of creating a FastTree guide tree.
4. Changed the executable search from `usr/bin/env python` to `usr/bin/env python3`.
5. Further added systemrecursionlimit from 10000 to 20000 to combat issues with large tree.

### WITCH v1.0.1
1. First working release across different platform and different python versions.
