**Syspop** is a package developed to simplify and modularize the synthesis of populations, enhancing efficiency and user-friendliness. The outputs generated by **Syspop** are independent of any downstream applications, such as agent-based models, making them versatile inputs for various modeling needs or standalone products. 

The documentation for the package can be found [here](https://github.com/jzanetti/Syspop/wiki). Any questions please contact: _Sijin.Zhang@esr.cri.nz_

## Installation
The package can be installed via:
```
pip install syspop
```

## Usage

A synthetic population can be created using:

```
from syspop.syspop import create as syspop_create

syspop_create(
    syn_areas = [135400, 111400, 110400],
    output_dir = "/tmp/syspop_test",
    pop_gender = pop_data["gender"],
    pop_ethnicity = pop_data["ethnicity"],
    geo_hierarchy = geog_data["hierarchy"],
    geo_location = geog_data["location"],
    geo_address = geog_data["address"],
    household = household_data["household"],
    socialeconomic = geog_data["socialeconomic"],
    work_data = work_data,
    home_to_work = commute_data["home_to_work"],
    school_data = school_data["school"],
    hospital_data = hospital_data["hospital"],
    supermarket_data = supermarket_data["supermarket"],
    restaurant_data = restaurant_data["restaurant"],
    assign_address_flag = True,
    rewrite_base_pop = False,
    use_parallel = True,
    ncpu = 8
)
```

Detailed descriptions of the input data for each argument can be found in [Input data](https://github.com/jzanetti/Syspop/wiki/Input-data).

It's important to note that all arguments in the syspop.create function are optional, and their requirement depends on the specific synthetic information that needs to be generated. To understand the interdependencies between different synthetic information, refer to the documentation available [here](https://github.com/jzanetti/Syspop/wiki/Synthetic-population)

## Release (for developer)
The package can be released by running:

```
make publish
```
