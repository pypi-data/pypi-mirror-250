# python_aeroshield

Python_aeroshield is a Python package that implements a Python interface to [Automationshield](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield)'s [Aeroshield](https://github.com/gergelytakacs/AutomationShield/wiki/AeroShield). Automationshield creates cheap and accessible tools for control engineering education in the form of Arduino shields, of which the Aeroshield is one.

This project was built to allow TU Delft students learning control engineering to use Python in their assignments, since that is what they are thought in the curriculum. This package provides a flexible controller class that lets users conveniently implement a controller and run it on the Arduino hardware.
