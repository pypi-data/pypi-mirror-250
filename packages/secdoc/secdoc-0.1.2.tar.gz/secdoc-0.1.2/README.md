## A simple Python module for working with protein secondary structure

# Pre-requisites
The following Python packages are required in order to use this package:
- `Biopython`; may require manual installation
- `subprocess` and `itertools`; these packages are included in most Python distributions.

Biopython also requires a working installation of DSSP in order to perform the required operations. The program can be installed with `sudo apt install dssp` on Debian Linux systems. For other platforms, consult the relevant package repository.

A full readme will be here eventually.
