```Python
from open_db import Client

# Create a new client
client = Client()

# Add a new database
db = client.add_db("Users")

# Get the database
db = client.get_db()

collections = db.get_collections()

# Delete data from the first collection
collections[0].delete_data(collections[0].data)

# Create a new data object
data = Data(foo='bar', baz=42)

# Convert the data object to a JSON string
json_data = data.to_json()

# Convert a JSON string to a data object
new_data = Data.from_json(json_data)
