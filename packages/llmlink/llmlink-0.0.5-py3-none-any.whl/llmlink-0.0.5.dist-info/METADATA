# LLMLink

LLMLink is a Python SDK designed to simplify the creation of chatbot-based applications using Gradio. The SDK offers an efficient way to interact with Language Learning Models (LLMs) and deploy Gradio applications around these models.

3. [Quickstart/Usage](#quickstartusage)

## Capabilities

LLMLink's capabilities are all focused around two classes - the `Model` class and the `App` class.

The `Model` class implements the ability to talk to a specific LLM/chatbot, while the `App` class implements the Gradio application around the specific `Model`.

## Installation
To install LLMLink, you can use pip to install directly from the GitHub repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jacobrenn/llmlink
```

## Quickstart/Usage
Here's a simple example of how you can use LLMLink to create an LLM-powered application, and then deploy it:

```python
import llmlink.model as Model
import llmlink.app as App

model = Model(openai_api_key='<your OpenAI API key>', model='gpt-3.5-turbo', model_type='chat_openai', memory=True)
app = App(model, feedback=True)
app.deploy()
```
