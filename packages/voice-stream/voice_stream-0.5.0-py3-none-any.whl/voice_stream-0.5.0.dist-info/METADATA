## Quick Install

<!-- start install -->
VoiceStream is distributed on [PyPI].  To install, run:

   ```text
   pip install voice-stream
   ```

This will install the bare minimum requirements of VoiceStream.
A lot of the value of VoiceStream comes when integrating it with different audio sources, speech recognition and
text to speech systems.  By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install 
the dependencies for specific integrations separately.

<!-- end install -->

## 🤔 What is VoiceStream

<!-- start elevator-pitch -->

VoiceStream is a framework for building voice bots using language models.

* Integrates with LangChain so you can take any LLM application.
* Makes it easy to use different Text-To-Speech and Speech Recognition models
* Uses asyncio and streaming throughout to provide a great user experience.
* Handles voice specific conversation flows, like interrupting the current speaker.

VoiceStream is built to make it easy to build voice applications on top of LangChain, but 
can work with any LLM framework.

## 🧱 What can you build with VoiceStream?

* :robot: **VoiceBots** - Chatbots that you can talk and listen to instead of typing.
* :telephone_receiver: **Automated Telephone Calls** - Make automated phone calls powered by LLMs and rich-content
* :teacher: **Voice Assistants** - Build your own voice assistant that can do anything you want.

## 🚀 How does VoiceStream help?

The main value props of VoiceStream is:
1. **Streaming** - Audio programming can be tricky in Python.  VoiceStream provides simple streaming commands that make it easy to string together audio applications. 
1. **Components** - Modular and easy-to-use components for various components of the system
