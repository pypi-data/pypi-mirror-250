Cockpit is a microscope graphical user interface.  It is a flexible
and easy to extend platform aimed at life scientists using bespoke
microscopes.  More detailed information is available:

- in the `Online documentation
  <https://microscope-cockpit.org/>`__

- on the `Micron Oxford website
  <https://micronoxford.com/python-microscope-cockpit>`__

- in the recently published `paper
  <https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-76>`__

Main Features
--------------

- **Easy to use and extend by life scientists:** Cockpit is completely
  written in Python and meant to be extended by the user.

- **Independent of the actual devices being used:** Cockpit uses
  Python's `Microscope package <https://www.python-microscope.org>`__
  to control the devices.  The graphical interface and experiments
  automatically adjust to the existing devices.

- **Very fast device control and time precision:** During experiments,
  devices are controlled via hardware signals.

- **Cross Platform:** Cockpit runs on GNU/Linux, Mac, and Windows.

- **FOSS:** Cockpit is free and open source software, released under
  the GPL.


The User Interface
------------------

The user interface is made up of a number of windows with the main
ones shown below.
