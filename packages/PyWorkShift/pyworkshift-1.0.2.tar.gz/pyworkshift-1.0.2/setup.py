	"""
    The PyShift library manages work schedules.  A work schedule consists of one or more teams who rotate through a sequence of shift and off-shift periods of time.  The PyShift project allows breaks during shifts to be defined as well as non-working periods of time (e.g. holidays and scheduled maintenance periods) that are applicable to the entire work schedule.
