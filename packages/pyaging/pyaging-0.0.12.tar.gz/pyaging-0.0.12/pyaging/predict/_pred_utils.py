def load_clock(clock_name: str, dir: str, logger, indent_level: int = 2) -> Tuple:
    """
    Loads the specified aging clock from a remote source and returns its components.

    This function downloads the weights and configuration of a specified aging clock from a
    remote server. It then loads and returns various components of the clock such as its
    features, weight dictionary, and any preprocessing or postprocessing steps. This allows
    users to instantiate and use the clock in their analyses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clock_name : str
        The name of the aging clock to be loaded. This name is used to construct the URL
        for downloading the clock's weights and configuration.

    dir : str
        The directory to deposit the downloaded file.

    logger : Logger
        A logger object used for logging information during the function execution.

    indent_level : int, optional
        The indentation level for the logger, by default 2. It controls the formatting
        of the log messages.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing the following components of the clock:
        - features: The features used by the clock.
        - reference_feature_values: Reference values for features in case features are missing.
        - weight_dict: A dictionary of weights used in the clock's model.
        - preprocessing: Any preprocessing steps required for the clock's input data.
        - postprocessing: Any postprocessing steps applied to the clock's output.
        - preprocessing_helper: Any preprocessing helper file.
        - postprocessing_helper: Any postprocessing helper file.

    Notes
    -----
    The clock's weights and configuration are assumed to be stored in a .pt (PyTorch) file
    on a remote server. The URL for the clock is constructed based on the clock's name.
    The function uses the `download` utility to retrieve the file. If the clock or its
    components are not found, the function may fail or return incomplete information.

    The logger is used extensively for progress tracking and information logging, enhancing
    transparency and user experience.

    Verifies if all required features are present in an AnnData object and adds missing features.

    This function checks an AnnData object (commonly used in single-cell analysis) to ensure
    that it contains all the necessary features specified in the 'features' list. If any features
    are missing, they are added to the AnnData object with a default value of 0 or with a reference
    value if given. This is crucial for downstream analyses where the presence of all specified
    features is assumed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata : anndata.AnnData
        The AnnData object to be checked. It is a commonly used data structure in single-cell
        genomics containing high-dimensional data.

    clock_name : str
        The name of the aging clock. The percent of missing features will be added to adata.uns

        A list of features (e.g., gene names or other identifiers) that are expected to be
        present in the 'adata'.

    reference_feature_values : list
        A list of the reference values for each feature. The order must match the order of features.

    -------
    anndata.AnnData
        The updated AnnData object, which includes any missing features added with a default

    Notes
    -----
    This function is particularly useful in preprocessing steps where the consistency of
    data structure across different datasets is crucial. The function modifies the AnnData
    object if there are missing features and logs detailed information about these modifications.

    The added features are initialized with zeros. This approach, while providing completeness,
    may introduce biases if not accounted for in downstream analyses. If reference values are
    provided, then they are used instead of zeros.

    assumes that the model is already trained and the data is preprocessed according to the model's requirements.
    A dataloader is used because of possible memory constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : torch.nn.Module
        A pre-trained machine learning model that can make predictions.

    adata : anndata.AnnData

    features : list of str
        A list of feature names to be included in the output array. Only these features from the AnnData object will
        be extracted for age prediction.

    device : str
        Device to move AnnData to during inference. Eithe 'cpu' or 'cuda'.

    logger : Logger
        A logger object for logging the progress or any relevant information during the prediction process.

        An array of predicted ages or biological markers, as returned by the model.

    Notes
    -----
    Ensure that the data is preprocessed (e.g., scaled, normalized) as required by the model before
    passing it to this function. The model should be in evaluation mode if it's a type that has different
    behavior during training and inference (e.g., PyTorch models).

    The exact nature of the predictions (e.g., age, biological markers) depends on the model being used.

    """
    Convert a PyTorch tensor to a flattened NumPy array.

    This utility function takes a PyTorch tensor and converts it into a 1D NumPy array. It is useful in scenarios
    where PyTorch tensors need to be processed or analyzed using NumPy-based tools or functions. The function ensures
    that the tensor is detached from the current computation graph (if applicable) and then flattens it to a 1D array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : torch.Tensor
        The PyTorch tensor to be converted. This can be a tensor of any shape.

    logger : Logger
        A logger object for logging the progress or any relevant information during the conversion process.

    indent_level : int, optional
        The indentation level for logging messages, by default 2.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy_array : ndarray
        A 1D NumPy array equivalent to the input tensor.

    Notes
    -----
    This function detaches the tensor from the computation graph, so it should be used with caution if the tensor
    is part of a PyTorch computational graph, such as when dealing with gradients in training neural networks.

    The flattening to a 1D array may lose the original shape information of the tensor, which should be considered
    if the shape is important for further processing.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> numpy_array = convert_tensor_to_numpy_array(tensor, logger)
    >>> numpy_array
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])

    """
    Add predicted ages to an AnnData object as a new column in the observation (obs) attribute. Also adds
    the specific clock metadata to the `uns` attribute of an AnnData object.

    This function appends the predicted ages, obtained from a biological aging clock or similar model, to
    the AnnData object's `obs` attribute. The predicted ages are added as a new column, named after the
    clock used to generate these predictions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata : anndata.AnnData
        The AnnData object to which the predicted ages will be added. It's a data structure for handling
        large-scale biological data, like gene expression matrices, commonly used in bioinformatics.

    predicted_ages : numpy.ndarray or list
        An array or list of predicted ages corresponding to the samples in the AnnData object. The length
        of this array should match the number of samples in `adata`.

    clock_name : str
        The name of the aging clock used to generate the predicted ages. This name will be used
        as the column name in `adata.obs`.

    dir: str
        The directory to deposit the downloaded file.

    logger : Logger
        A logger object for logging the progress or relevant information during the operation.

    indent_level : int, optional
        The indentation level for logging messages, by default 2.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This function modifies the AnnData object in-place and does not return any value.

    Notes
    -----
    It is essential to ensure that the length of `predicted_ages` matches the number of samples in the
    `adata` object. Mismatch in lengths will lead to errors or misaligned data.

    This function is part of a pipeline that integrates aging clock predictions with the
    standard data structures used in bioinformatics, facilitating downstream analyses like visualization
    or statistical testing.

    Returns adata with original features.

    This function checks for variables that have 100% of samples with missing features, and removes them
    from the adata object. It is useful for returning the adata in the original state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata : anndata.AnnData
        The AnnData object that will be filtered.

    logger : Logger
        A logger object for logging the progress or relevant information during the operation.

        The filtered adata in which all features appear in at least one sample.

    Notes
    -----
    During filtering, the adata object is filtered based on a column called "percent_na" which should be less
    than 1. If the column is not present, an error will appear.

def set_torch_device(logger, indent_level: int = 1) -> None:
    """
    Set and return the PyTorch device based on the availability of CUDA.

    This function checks if CUDA is available in the system and accordingly sets the PyTorch device to
    either 'cuda' or 'cpu'. If CUDA is available, it utilizes GPU acceleration for PyTorch operations,
    significantly enhancing computation speed for large datasets. The chosen device is logged for
    user reference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logger : Logger
        A logger object for logging the selected device.

    indent_level : int, optional
        The indentation level for logging messages, by default 1.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.device
        The PyTorch device object set to 'cuda' if CUDA is available, or 'cpu' otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    The function automatically detects the availability of CUDA and makes a decision without user input.
    This makes it convenient for deploying code on different machines without the need for manual
    configuration.

    It is important to use the returned device for all PyTorch operations to ensure that they are
    executed on the correct hardware (CPU or GPU).
