# shares

---

## description
Started from the shell, "shares" presents files in the current working directory (cwd) that have extension ".s.HTML" (case sensitive).

---		
		
## install
`[ZSH] pip install shares`

---


## start from shell
`[ZSH] shares`

Shares starts on port 2468, or the first avaible port after that.  
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:2468  

### This is an example ".s.HTML" file:
```
<pre>
	<h1>This is an example HTML file.</h1>
	<p>
		It really only needs the "pre" tag to    
		look like a reflection of its contents in a browser.   
	</p>   
	<p>
		Tags like "html" and "body" are actually not   
		necessary for rendering HTML in modern browsers.  
	</p>   
	<p>  
		for text to wrap, instead of extending off the page,    
		style "white-space: pre-wrap" can be utilized instead of 
		a "pre" tag like so:
		
		<div style="white-space: pre-wrap"></div>
	</p>
</pre>
```

However, weathered frontend developers and         
companies might have a problem with that,    
so here's a structure that might not anger    
and confuse bitter NPCs.     
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>	
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<main>
			<article style="white-space: pre-wrap">
			
			
			</article>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

---

## start programmatically
```
import pathlib
from os.path import dirname, join, normpath
this_folder = pathlib.Path (__file__).parent.resolve ()

import shares
shares.start ({
	"extension": ".s.HTML",
	
	#
	#	This is the node from which the traversal occur.
	#
	"directory": str (this_folder) + "/structures/shares",
	
	#
	#	This path is removed from the absolute path of share files found.
	#
	"relative path": str (this_folder) + "/structures/shares"
})
```
