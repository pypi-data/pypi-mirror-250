A guided interview for creating a Last Will and Testatment for a LAWV Will Clinic.  The interview assumes that it is going to be completed by an attorney or paralegal assisting in the clinic after the client has already submitted a Will Clinic questionnaire.  The interview seeks biographical information about the testator and family.  It then seeks specific gifts, general gifts, residual assignees, executors, and guardians. The interview produces a Word document to allow for final edits.
