# Getting started with Mirascope

This library intends to give developers a better way to build with LLMs that integrates seamlessly into your workflow, starting with better prompt management and core LLM interaction calls. Weâ€™re building the de facto pythonic prompt templating and LLM-interaction library.

## A Simple Mirascope Example

```python
from mirascope import OpenAIChat, Prompt

class BookRecommendationPrompt(Prompt):
    """
    Can you recommend some books on {topic}?
    """

    topic: str

prompt = BookRecommendationPrompt(topic="coding")
print(str(prompt))

model = OpenAIChat(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")
res = model.create(prompt)
print(str(res))
```

```
Can you recommend some books on coding?

Certainly! Here are some highly recommended books on coding: ...
