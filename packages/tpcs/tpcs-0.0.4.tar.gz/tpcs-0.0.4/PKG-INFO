# Time Pattern Cohesion Score

## Introduction

https://pypi.org/project/tpcs/0.0.4/

TPCS is a metric to assess how well time-dependent patterns within a time series signal remain connected over time, with an emphasis on recency. 

![TPCS](https://github.com/karaposu/time-pattern-cohesion-score/blob/main/tpcs_illustration.png)

### We calculate TPCS using 4 main features :

**Consistency** : shows if data collection is consistent with respect to  start and end time of data crawling  , (from  2020-09 to current time)

**Intra Consistency** : shows if data collection was consistent with respect to signal’s own start and end time. 

**Contiguity** : shows how contiguous data is. 5 is fully contiguous which means all existed values are sequential

**Recent Contiguity** : shows how contiguous recent data is.

## Installation

```python
pip install tpcs
```

## How does it work?

###How TPC score is calculated?

We are first extracting relevant attributes from signals with the help of sequentiality package.  These attributes are:

1. total sample size (**n_of_samples**)

2. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months  (**LCS_m**)

3. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months with 1 gap month (**LCS_m_1g**)

4. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months with 2 gap month (**LCS_m_1g**)

5. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months from last timestamp (**LCS_m_from_last**)

6. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months from last timestamp  with 1 gap month (**LCS_m_from_last_1g**)

7. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months from last timestamp  with 2 gap month  (**LCS_m_from_last_2g**)

8. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months from end time (**LCS_m_from_end**)

9. Longest Consecutive Subsequence of months from end time  with 1 gap month  (**LCS_m_from_end_1g**)

 
And then these attributes are group together into 4 features:

**Consistency** : shows if data collection is consistent with respect to  start and end time of data crawling  , (from  2020-09 to current time)

**Intra Consistency** : shows if data collection was consistent with respect to signal’s own start and end time. 

**Contiguity** : shows how contiguous data is. 5 is fully contiguous which means all existed values are sequential

**Recent Contiguity** : shows how contiguous recent data is. 

Then These features are turned into scores by calculating their ratio to max signal length and normalizing them between 0 and 5. 

And we take weighted avg of these normalized scores to calculate TPC.  

## Features & Usage

TPC score designed as a data quality assesment for time signals. It is really easy to use. 


```python

#Lets assume we have signal of interest. TPC requires dates of this signal as input. 

import datetime
date_list = ['2023-01-01', '2023-02-01', '2023-03-01', '2023-04-01', '2023-05-01', '2023-06-01', '2023-07-01', '2023-08-01', '2023-09-01', '2023-11-01', '2023-12-01', '2024-01-01']
# there are 12 months in this list. '2023-10-01'  is missing.  

date_list = [datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d").date() for date_str in specific_dates]

weights={ "contiguity_score":0.5,
                  "recent_contiguity_score":3,
                  "consistency_score":0.8,
                  "intra_consistency_score":1
    
          }
  
MAX_LEN_MONTHS=  13  
END_OF_TIME=  '2024-01-01' 

tpcs =TPCS(date_list, MAX_LEN_MONTHS, END_OF_TIME=END_OF_TIME,  debug=False, return_details=True)
TPC_score, tpcs_details=tpcs.calculate_TPCS(weights=weights, printing=False)
 

```
