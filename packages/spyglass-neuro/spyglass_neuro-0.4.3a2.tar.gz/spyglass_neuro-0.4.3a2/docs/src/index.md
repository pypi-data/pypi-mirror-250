# Spyglass

**Spyglass** is a data analysis framework that facilitates the storage,
analysis, and sharing of neuroscience data to support reproducible research. It
is designed to be interoperable with the NWB format and integrates open-source
tools into a coherent framework.

## Getting Started

This site hosts both [installation instructions](./installation.md) and
[tutorials](./notebooks/index.md) to help you get started with Spyglass. We
recommend running the notebooks yourself. They can be downloaded from GitHub
[here](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass).

## Diving Deeper

The [API Reference](./api/index.md) provides a detailed description of all the
tables and class functions in Spyglass via python docstrings. Potential
contributors should also read the [Developer Guide](./contribute.md). Those
interested in in hosting a Spyglass instance for their own data should read the
[database management guide](./misc/database_management.md).

We have a series of additional docs under the [misc](./misc/index.md) folder
that may be helpful. Our [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) highlights the changes that
have been made to Spyglass over time and the [copyright](./LICENSE.md) page
contains license information.
