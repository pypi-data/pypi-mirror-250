# Threddar

Threddar is a python module which allows you to create "thread groups". It is also a overall wrapper around the threading library.
It's pretty simple.
If there's still someone hanging out on ancient Python, this only works on 3.9+.

## Why Threddar?

Threddar provides a wrapper around the threading library - rethread (VERY not complete yet), and also allows you to group threads into threddars. These can do the same things as threads, but are very useful for organization.
Effectively, threddars are just a subclass of lists, but for threads.
