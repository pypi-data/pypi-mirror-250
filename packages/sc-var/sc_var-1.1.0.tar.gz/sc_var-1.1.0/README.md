# SC-VAR

An approach to interpreting disease-associated human variants using single-cell epigenomics


# What can sc-var do?

Identify risk genes, gene sets, and cells related to different stages and diseases. 

Infer cell types involved in complex traits and diseases using single-cell epigenomes AND does not rely on any other annotations and other Omics data. 


# How to install?

pip install sc-var
