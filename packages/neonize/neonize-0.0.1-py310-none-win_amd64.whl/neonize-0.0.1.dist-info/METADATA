# Neonize

</center>
<p align="justify">Neonize is a custom binding library designed to connect seamlessly with the functions of the whatsmeow library. Acting as a mediator, it facilitates smooth integration between your application and whatsmeow's basic features. By adopting a binding approach, Neonize allows your code to take advantage of whatsmeow's capabilities while ensuring seamless and cohesive interoperability. This binding setup enables granular integration, acting like a bridge between your application logic and the powerful operations of the whatsmeow library. Notably, data exchange is handled through protobuf for streamlined communication and increased efficiency in the integration process.
