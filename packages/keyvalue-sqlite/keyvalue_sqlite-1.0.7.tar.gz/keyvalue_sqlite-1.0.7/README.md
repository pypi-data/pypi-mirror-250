# KeyValueSqlite

Super easy drop in replacement for python dictionary, which stores
it's key-value to an sqlite database.

# API

```python
from keyvalue_sqlite import KeyValueSqlite

DB_PATH = '/path/to/db.sqlite'

db = KeyValueSqlite(DB_PATH, 'table-name')
# Now use standard dictionary operators
db.set_default('0', '1')
actual_value = db.get('0')
assert '1' == actual_value
db.set_default('0', '2')
assert '1' == db.get('0')
```

New in 1.0.4: atomic integers.

```python
from keyvalue_sqlite import KeyValueSqlite

DB_PATH = '/path/to/db.sqlite'

db = KeyValueSqlite(DB_PATH, 'table-name')
# Now use standard dictionary operators
db.set_default('atomic_var', '1')
db.atomic_add('atomic_var', '2')
val = db.get('atomic_var')
assert '3' == actual_value
```

This datastructure is not going to win any performance races, but it
is super simple to use with just a few lines of code. This is a great
option for one of those small web apps which doesn't have enough load
to justify mysql or postgres, or a file that will be used by multiple
processes, or to store a file that can't be corrupted during a power
failure.

When fetching large amounts of data try to use get_many() or dict_range().
