Integrating web frameworks with Asphalt
=======================================

.. highlight:: bash

This library exists to enable easy integration of various web frameworks with Asphalt.
To do this, the web application must be run as part of an Asphalt application.

There are two fundamental approaches to integrating web frameworks with Asphalt:

#. Pass a ready-made application object (usually with the routes defined already) to the
   framework-specific component provided here
#. Let the framework-specific component create the application object, and inject it
   into subcomponents as a resource, and add routes dynamically there (not possible with
   the ``asgi`` and ``django`` components)

Practical examples
------------------

The two different methods are demonstrated in the following examples.

In ``static.py``, an application object is made and then handler for the root path is
added to it. Then it gets picked up by the framework specific component.

In ``dynamic.py``, a component gets declared instead. This component gets the
application injected into its ``start()`` method, where the handler for the root path is
installed to the application.

Django is an exception to this, as it requires a specific project structure. For Django,
its ``views.py`` module is presented here. The complete example can be found in the
:github:`repository <examples/django>`. In particular it should be noted that the
Asphalt middleware (needed for resource injection) needs to be added to ``MIDDLEWARE``
in the project's ``settings.py`` file.

         .. tab:: config.yaml

            .. include:: ../examples/aiohttp/config.yaml
               :code: yaml

To run these examples, copy all files to the same directory, and then (assuming
``asphalt-web`` and the appropriate web framework itself are installed)::

    PYTHONPATH=. asphalt run config.yaml --service static

or, for the ``dynamic`` alternative (where available)::

    PYTHONPATH=. asphalt run config.yaml --service dynamic

Injecting resources to handler functions
----------------------------------------

In most cases, dependency injection works the same with request handler functions: you
decorate the function with ``@inject`` and add one or more type annotated arguments with
``resource()`` as the default. One framework – FastAPI – requires special measures,
however. See the :ref:`FastAPI section <FastAPI>` for details.

Adding middleware
-----------------

All applications will be automatically wrapped by the Asphalt middleware, but you can
add your own middleware on top of that. All frameworks supported here (except AIOHTTP)
can be wrapped with ASGI 3.0 middleware, while AIOHTTP will need its own specific kind
of middleware.

.. note:: The application resource available on the global context is the unwrapped
          application, and is unaffected by middleware.
