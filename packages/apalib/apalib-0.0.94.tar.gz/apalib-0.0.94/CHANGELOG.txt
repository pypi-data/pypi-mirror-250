v0.0.9x
    + Added (very) rough FASTA fetching support.
    --> Very much needs to be optimized. Boo the PDB and its jank
    + Can now save a fetch in RAM. Set "hold_pdb" to True in fetching functions

v0.0.7x
    + Moved more hardcoded data into a json file
    + Added a "Data" class to access json file
    + More restructuring
    + Remade PDB parser to be more stable, faster, and human-readable
    --> More work must be done for ANISOU, REMARK, etc.\
    + Modify all class initializations for more consistancy
    --> Change from class_instance(**kwargs) to class_instance(arg1=None, arg2=None, ...) for all parameters


v0.0.2 January 27, 2022 (Pre-release alpha)
    + Added global CONTAINER object with appropriate getters and setters.
    + Moved (most) hardcoded data into a json file
    + Added function to estimate charge of a protein at different pHs
    --> Will modify to estimate nucleoproteins, riobnucleoproteins, and protein segments
    + Added SOME test files. More to come
    * This version is released only for testing and developmental purposes.
    --> There is NO guarantee of accuracy, efficiency, or functionality for this version.
    --> The purpose of this version is to ensure the proper upload of the json data file to PyPI

v0.0.1 Oct 12, 2021 (Pre-release alpha)
    + Added PDB parser. Currently, able to organize atoms into RNA chains, DNA chains, protein chains, and heteroatoms.
    + Add centroid finder for amino acids.
    + Added automatic fetch from PDB
    + Added method to atom class that extracts the probable element from its ID
    + Added getters and setters for RNA, DNA, AminoAcid, Atom, and Container classes
