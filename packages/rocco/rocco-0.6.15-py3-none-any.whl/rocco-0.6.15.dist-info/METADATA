Underlying ROCCO is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved efficiently to **predict consensus regions of open chromatin** across multiple samples.

**Features**

1. Explicitly accounts for both **enrichment and spatial characteristics** of open chromatin signals to capture the full extent of peaks;
2. **No arbitrary thresholds** on the minimum number of supporting samples/replicates;
3. Is efficient for **large numbers of samples** with an asymptotic time complexity independent of sample count;
4. **Does not require training data** or initial candidate peak regions which are hard to define given the lack of a priori sets of open chromatin regions;
5. Employs a **mathematically tractable model** permitting guarantees of performance and efficiency.
