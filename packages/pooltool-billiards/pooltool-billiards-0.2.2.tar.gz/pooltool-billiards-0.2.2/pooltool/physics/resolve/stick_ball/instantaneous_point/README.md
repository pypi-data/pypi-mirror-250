This collision assumes the stick-ball interaction is instantaneous and point-like. The equation comes from Leckie and Greenspan's 2006 "An Event-Based Pool Physics Simulator" (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11922155_19). Since they provide no citations in it's brief derivation (which is missing in the [free preprint](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.89.4627&rep=rep1&type=pdf)), we can in good faith assume this is their own equation.
