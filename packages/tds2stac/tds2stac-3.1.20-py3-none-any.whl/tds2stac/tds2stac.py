class TDS2STACIntegrator(object):
    """
    This class is the central component of the TDS2STAC. It harvests the TDS catalog
    and then generates the STAC-Catalog, -Collections, and -Items through the TDS catalogs,
    based on the user's input.
    This class mainly defines all configurations related to harvesting and STAC creation.
    In the first step, it recognizes the scenario of the TDS catalog using :class:`~tds2stac.Recognizer`.
    If it is recognized as a nested collection, :class:`~tds2stac.NestedCollectionInspector` is responsible for
    determining the nested collection's `ID`, `Title`, and `url` of subdirectories. Other procedures follow
    in succession. For example, :class:`~tds2stac.CollectionHarvester` harvests the collection's information
    and :class:`~tds2stac.STACCreator` creates the STAC-Catalog and -Collection. Then, :class:`~tds2stac.ItemHarvester`
    harvests the item's information and :class:`~tds2stac.STACCreator` creates the STAC-Item and connect them
    to the related STAC-Collections. At the end each STAC-Collection will be connected to the main STAC-Catalog.

    Args:
        TDS_catalog(str) : The URL address of the TDS catalog that will be harvested.
        stac_dir (str, Optional) : Directory of saving created STAC catalogs.
        stac_id (str, Optional): STAC catalog ID. default value is 'TDS2STAC'.
        stac_title (str, optional): STAC catalog Title. default value is 'TDS2STAC'.
        stac_description (str, optional): STAC catalog description.
        stac_existence (bool, optional): Verifying the presence of the STAC catalog in order to
            update an existing catalog; if not, a new catalog will be generated.
        stac_existence_collection (bool, optional): Verifying the presence of the STAC Collection
            in order to update an existing catalog; if not, a new collection will be generated.
        collection_tuples (list, optional): The elements of this tuple comprise the auto-TDS2STAC-generated ID
            , the user-defined ID, title, and description of the STAC-Collection respectively. (auto-ID, user-ID,
            user-title, user-description).
        datetime_filter (list, optional): Datetime-based filtering of harvesting. It works based on the `modified`
            tag in each dataset at TDS.
        aggregated_dataset_url (str, optional): Dataset's URL of each data entry in the Aggregated datasets of TDS.
        depth_number (int, optional) : depth number of nested datasets if it is a nested collection. default value is 0.
        limited_number (int, optional): The objective is to reduce the quantity of harvested items in each collection. It is beneficial
            for developing and testing purposes.
        spatial_information (list, optional): Spatial information of 2D datasets e.g. [minx, maxx, miny, maxy] or 1D dataset e.g.
            [x,y]. default value is None.
        temporal_format_by_dataname (str, optional): A preferred datetime format for datasets that include the time period in their names. e.g
            "e%y%m%d%H.%M%S%f"
        item_geometry_linestring (bool, optional): Set True to make a LineString geometry for STAC-Items from wms service.
            Otherwise it makes Polygon geometry for the given Item. default value is False.
        extension_properties (dict, optional): A dictionary of properties for extensions. default is None.
            For more information about the keys, please refer to the :class:`~tds2stac.TDS2STACIntegrator.extension_properties`.

        requests_properties (dict, optional): A dictionary that modify the requests to
            URLs. To obtain additional information on this topic, refer to
            the :class:`~tds2stac.TDS2STAC.requests_properties`. The default value is
            an empty dictionary.

            you desire to include in the STAC-Collection and STAC-Items. To obtain

            is set to None.
        **collection_thumbnail_link (str, optional)**:
            This property is reliant upon the values of `collection_thumbnail` and
            `collection_overview`. When the value of either of these attributes is
            set to `link`, it allows for the inclusion of a hyperlink to an image
            for `collection_thumbnail` or `collection_overview`.
        **collection_overview_link (str, optional)**:
            This property is reliant upon the values of `collection_thumbnail` and
            `collection_overview`. When the value of either of these attributes is
            set to `link`, it allows for the inclusion of a hyperlink to an image
            for `collection_thumbnail` or `collection_overview`.
        **collection_custom_assets (list, optional)**:
            This is a list of asset dictionaris that includes the `key`, `href`, and
            `title`, `role` (as a list), and `media_type` of the asset. The default
            value is set to None. For more information, refer to the :ref:`custom-asset`.
        **item_thumbnail (bool, optional)**:
            A `thumbnail` asset for STAC-Items sourced from the Web Map Service (WMS)
            of the TDS. The default value is set to False.
        **item_overview (bool, optional)**:
            A `overview` asset for STAC-Items sourced from the Web Map Service (WMS)
            of the TDS. The default value is set to False.
        **item_getminmax_thumbnail (bool, optional)**:
            The TDS offers a function that allows users to obtain the minimum and maximum
            values of the colorbar associated with an image through the use of `metadata`.
            The aforementioned attribute is contingent upon both the `item_thumbnail` and
            `item_overview`. The default value is set to False.
        **assets_list_allowed (list, optional)**:
            This is a list of permissible web services that will be incorporated as assets
            in the STAC-Item. The :class:`~tds2stac.WebServiceScraper` class provides access
            to the list of available web services. Default value is None.

            This is a list of web services that will be excluded from the STAC-Item asset
            list. The :class:`~tds2stac.WebServiceScraper` class provides access to the
            list of available webservices. Default value is None.
        **explore_data (bool, optional)**:
            By enabling the `True` setting, the inclusion of Godiva3 as an exploration asset will be implemented.
        **verify_explore_data (bool, optional)**:
            This argument verifies the availability of the `GetMetadata` function. The provided
            function facilitates the retrieval of data necessary for generating maps using the
            Web Map Service (WMS) protocol. However, an error occurs when attempting to open
            `Godiva3` when this function doesn't work. In order to mitigate such errors, it
            would be advisable to establish this argument.
        **jupyter_notebook (bool, optional)**:
            This argument posits the inclusion of the Jupyter Notebook as an asset.
    """
