# Calculator Class README

This README provides detailed information on how to use each method in the Calculator class, along with use cases and considerations.

## Introduction

The Calculator class is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers. It includes methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and calculating the nth root of a number.

## Installation

You can install the calculator package using pip. Open a terminal and run the following command:

pip install calculator

### Class Methods
1. add(self, first_number: float = 0, second_number: float = 0) -> float
Adds two numbers and returns the sum.

Example:
from calculator import Calculator

calculator = Calculator()
result = calculator.add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8.0

2. subtract(self, first_number: float = 0, second_number: float = 0) -> float
Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.

Example:
from calculator import Calculator

calculator = Calculator()
result = calculator.subtract(10, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 6.0

3. multiply(self, first_number: float = 0, second_number: float = 0) -> float
Multiplies two numbers and returns the product.

Example
from calculator import Calculator

calculator = Calculator()
result = calculator.multiply(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 6.0

4. divide(self, first_number: float = 0, second_number: float = 0) -> float
Divides the first number by the second and returns the result.
Raises:
ValueError: If attempting to divide by zero.

Example
from calculator import Calculator

calculator = Calculator()
result = calculator.divide(8, 2)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0

5. nth_root(self, first_number: float, n: int) -> float:
calculates the nth root of a number.

from calculator import Calculator

calculator = Calculator()
result_nth_root = calculator.nth_root(64, 2)  # Square root of 64 = 8.0


### Running Tests
To run the tests, make sure you have unittest installed:

pip install unittest

Then, run the tests using:

python -m unittest tests.test_calculator

### Notes
**Ensure that the Calculator class is instantiated before using its methods.
**Be cautious when using the divide method to avoid division by zero.
**When using the nth_root method, be aware of the restriction on calculating the even root of a negative number.
**Feel free to customize and integrate the Calculator class into your projects for basic arithmetic calculations.
