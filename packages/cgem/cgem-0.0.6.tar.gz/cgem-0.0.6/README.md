# Collaborative Generalized Effects Modeling (CGEM): A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

Collaborative Generalized Effects Modeling (CGEM) is a state-of-the-art statistical modeling framework tailored for complex, real-world scenarios. Bridging traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning, CGEM stands out in its ability to interpret intricate data relationships found in domains like business analytics and scientific research.

## Defining Characteristics of CGEM

### Formulaic Flexibility

CGEM is characterized by an unprecedented level of formulaic freedom. This flexibility allows for the construction of models encompassing a diverse range of mathematical relationships, from linear to non-linear, multiplicative, and beyond. It's an essential feature that enables the modeling of complex dynamics in datasets.

### Generalization of Effects

In CGEM, the concept of an 'effect' is broadly interpreted. Effects can range from simple constants or linear terms to outputs from sophisticated machine learning models. This generalization allows CGEM to integrate and leverage diverse methodologies within a single model framework, offering a comprehensive view of the data.

### Iterative Refinement and Convergence

CGEM employs an iterative process to refine and converge the terms in the model. This approach ensures balanced weighting of each effect, mitigating common issues like overfitting or variable dominance. The focus is on achieving a natural and efficient convergence of terms, enhancing model robustness.

### Causal Coherence

A cornerstone of CGEM is its emphasis on maintaining causally coherent relationships within the model. This focus ensures that the outputs are not just statistically significant but also meaningful and interpretable in real-world contexts, bridging the gap between correlation and causation.

### Integration with Machine Learning

CGEM is uniquely designed to incorporate machine learning models as effects. This integration harnesses the predictive power of machine learning while maintaining the structural integrity and interpretability of traditional statistical models.

## Core Mechanics of CGEM

CGEM operates on an iterative algorithm, adjusting the effects within the model to achieve the best fit to the data. The process involves:

- **Defining a Model**: Specifying the relationship between dependent and independent variables using a flexible and expressive formula syntax.
- **Incorporating Effects**: Including various effects, ranging from statistical terms to outputs from machine learning models.
- **Iterative Optimization**: Continually refining the model through an iterative process, ensuring each effect is appropriately calibrated.

Generating Artificial Data
First, we define a function to generate artificial data, simulating a causal system:

```python
from cgem import *
import numpy as np
from random import choice
import pandas as pd

def gen_artificial_data_v1(size=10000):
    # Generating random values for variables
    reg_var_a = np.random.normal(10, 3, size)
    reg_var_b = np.random.normal(12, 4, size)
    reg_var_c = np.random.normal(15, 5, size)

    # Calculating the effect
    effect_x = 20.0 + (1.0 * reg_var_a) + (1.5 * reg_var_b) + (2.0 * reg_var_c)

    # Defining categories and effects
    cats = list("ABCDEFGHIJ")
    effs = np.around(np.linspace(0.5, 1.4, len(cats)), 2)
    cat2effect = {cat: round(eff, 4) for cat, eff in zip(cats, effs)}

    # Generating categorical variable and its effect
    cat_var_d = np.array([choice(cats) for _ in range(size)])
    cat_effect_d = np.array([cat2effect[c] for c in cat_var_d])

    # Adding noise effect
    noise_effect = np.random.uniform(0.90, 1.10, size)

    # Calculating the target variable
    target_var_z = ((effect_x) * cat_effect_d) * noise_effect

    # Constructing the DataFrame
    return pd.DataFrame({
        'TGT_Z': target_var_z,
        'REG_A': reg_var_a,
        'REG_B': reg_var_b,
        'REG_C': reg_var_c,
        'CAT_D': cat_var_d
    })

# Generate two datasets for fitting and prediction
DF1 = gen_artificial_data_v1(size=10000)
DF2 = gen_artificial_data_v1(size=10000) 
```

## Model Fitting
Next, we fit a CGEM model to the generated data:

### Define the formula for the model
```python
Formula = "TGT_Z = CAT_D_EFF * LIN_REG_EFF"
```

### Define terms model parameters
```python
tparams = {
    "CAT_D_EFF": {
        'model': "CatRegModel()", 
        'xvars': ['CAT_D'],
        'ival' : 10,
    },
    "LIN_REG_EFF": {
        'model': "OLS()", 
        'xvars': ['REG_A','REG_B','REG_C'],
        'ival' : 10,
    } 
}   
```

### Initialize and fit the model
```python
model = CGEM() 
model.load_df(DF1)  
model.define_form(Formula) 
model.define_terms(tparams)  
model.fit(25)
```

### Make predictions and calculate R-Squared
```python
preds = model.predict(DF2) 
actuals = DF2['TGT_Z'].values
r2 = model.calc_r2(actuals, preds) 
print('CrosVal R-Squared:', round(r2, 5))
```

## Model Process Explanation (Step-By-Step) 

### Conceptual Overview
CGEM's modeling process is characterized by its adaptability and integration of various statistical and machine learning techniques. The key steps in this process include formulating the model, integrating diverse effects, iterative optimization, and ensuring causal coherence.

### 1. Defining the Formula of the Model
The first step is to define a model formula. This formula represents the relationship between the dependent variable and an array of independent variables or 'effects.' Unlike traditional models, CGEM allows for complex, non-linear, and interactive relationships. 

```python
from cgem import CGEM

# Define the formula
# Here, 'TGT_Z' is the target variable, and 
# 'CAT_D_EFF' and 'LIN_REG_EFF' are the effects
Formula = "TGT_Z = CAT_D_EFF * LIN_REG_EFF"
```

### 2. Integrating Diverse Effects
In CGEM, effects can range from simple linear terms to outputs from sophisticated machine learning models. This flexibility allows the model to capture more complex patterns in the data.

```python
# Define terms model parameters
tparams = {
    "CAT_D_EFF": {
        'model': "CatRegModel()",  # Categorical Regression Model
        'xvars': ['CAT_D'],        # Independent variable for this effect
        'ival' : 10,               # Initial value
    },
    "LIN_REG_EFF": {
        'model': "OLS()",          # Ordinary Least Squares Model
        'xvars': ['REG_A', 'REG_B', 'REG_C'],  # Independent variables for this effect
        'ival' : 10,               # Initial value
    }
}
```

### 3. Iterative Optimization
CGEM models are refined through an iterative process. This process involves adjusting the effects to achieve the best possible fit with the data, enhancing accuracy and reducing overfitting.

```python
# Initialize the CGEM model
model = CGEM()

# Load the dataset
model.load_df(DF1)

# Define the model formula and terms
model.define_form(Formula)
model.define_terms(tparams)

# Fit the model
model.fit(25);
```

### 4. Evaluating Model Performance
After fitting the model, it's important to evaluate its performance. This can be done by making predictions on a new dataset and comparing them to actual values.

```python
# Predict using a new dataset
preds = model.predict(DF2) 

# Actual values
actuals = DF2['TGT_Z'].values

# Calculate R-Squared for model performance
r2 = model.calc_r2(actuals, preds) 
print('CrosVal R-Squared:', round(r2, 5))
```
