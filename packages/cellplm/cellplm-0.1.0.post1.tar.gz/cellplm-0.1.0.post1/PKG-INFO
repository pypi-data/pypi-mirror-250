# CellPLM
This is the official codebase for [CellPLM: Pre-training of Cell Language Model Beyond Single Cells](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.03.560734).

***CellPLM*** is the first single-***Cell*** ***P***re-trained ***L***anguage ***M***odel that encodes cell-cell relations and it consistently outperforms existing pre-trained and non-pre-trained models in diverse downstream tasks, with 100x higher inference speed compared to existing pre-trained models.

## Installation
We recommend PyPI for quick installation. We recommend using `python 3.9` and `cuda>=11.7` but they are adjustable.


### Quick Installation with PyPI
Make sure gpu version of pytorch (>=1.13.0) has been installed before installing CellPLM.
```
pip install cellplm
```

### Full Installation (recommended for HPC users and developers)
```
conda create -n cellplm python=3.9 -y && conda activate cellplm
conda install cudatoolkit=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The full installation will install the same environment as we used during development. This includes `rapids` used to accelerate evaluation.

## Tutorials
We offer several [notebooks](https://github.com/OmicsML/CellPLM/tree/main/tutorials) for various downstream tasks as introductory tutorials. 

We are also working on developing more streamlined protocols for supported tasks and a comprehensive documentation. We aim to release these by the end of the year.

## Pretrained CellPLM Model Checkpoints
The checkpoint can be acquired from our [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/i5rmxgtqzg7iykt2e9uqm/h?rlkey=o8hi0xads9ol07o48jdityzv1&dl=0). We might update our checkpoints from time to time.

[10/10/2023] The latest version is `20230926_85M`.
