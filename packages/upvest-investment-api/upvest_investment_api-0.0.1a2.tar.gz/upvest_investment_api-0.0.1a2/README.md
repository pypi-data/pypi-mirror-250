# Upvest Investment API

This Python package is **not** a fully fledged API client.

So far, it implements the parts of the [HTTP Message Signatures, draft version 15](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-15) functionality which are required to interact with the Upvest Investment API.

Next to a generic implementation, this is also provided as a [custom authentication mechanism](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#custom-authentication) for the [popular `requests` Python package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
