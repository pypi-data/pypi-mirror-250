# TypedGraphPy
Graph data structure with an enforcable schema
Port of TypedGraph originally for rust.

TypedraphPy is build to provide an easy to use interface for graph made by TypedGraph in Rust

## Getting started
install using
```
pip install typed_graph
```

see the example folder for information on how to Create your first TypedGraph and retrieve data from it

## Development
To run a local instance of the library:
```
.../typed_graph> pip install -e typed_graph_py
```

This will import the library using a symlink, so changes in the directory will be propegated to the python installation

Now it can be used as normal
```
import type_graph
```
