# Run 'em: Run your developer-local tasks faster

## 1. Overview

`runem` (run 'em) is a utility designed to optimise the process of running developer jobs concurrently.

Job definitions are declarative and simple and the reports show how long each job took. 

The name "runem" is derived from the fusion of "run" and "them," encapsulating the essence of executing tasks seamlessly.

## 2. Features

- **Tagged Jobs:** Use tagging to define which type of jobs you want to run, be it `pre-commit`, `lint`, `test` or in multi-project codebases to split between running `python`, `node.js` or `c++` jobs, depending on the context you are working in!

- **Multiprocess Execution:** Leverage the power of multiprocessing for concurrent test job execution, optimizing efficiency and reducing runtime.
  
- **Data-Driven Test Management:** Drive your tests with data, making it easy to adapt and scale your testing suite to various scenarios, allowing you to execute, track, and analyze your dev-ops suite with ease.

## 3. Installation

```bash
pip install runem
```

## 4. Basic Usage

```bash
$ runem [--tags tag1,tag2,tag3] [--not-tags tag1,tag2,tag3] \
        [--phases phaseX, phaseY] \
        [--MY-OPTION] [--not-MY-OPTION] 
#or
$ python -m runem [--tags tag1,tag2,tag3] [--not-tags tag1,tag2,tag3] \
                  [--phases phaseX, phaseY] \
                  [--MY-OPTION] [--not-MY-OPTION] 
```

### 4.1. Tag filters
Jobs are tagged in the .runem.yml config file. Each unique tags is made available on the command-line. To see which tags are available use `--help`. To add a new tag extend the `tags` field in the `job` config.

You can control which types of jobs to run via tags. Just tag the job in the config and then from the command-line you can add `--tags` or `--not-tags` to refine exactly which jobs will be run. 

To debug why a job is not selected pass `--verbose`.

For example, if you have a `python` tagged job or jobs, to run only run those jobs you would do the following:

```bash
runem --tags python
```

`--tags` are exclusive filter in, that is the tags passed in replace are the only tags that are run. This allows one to focus on running just a subset of tags.

`--not-tags` are subtractive filter out, that is any job with these tags are not run, even if they have tags set via the `--tags` switch. Meaning you can choose to run `python` tagged job but not run the `lint` jobs with `--tags python --not-tags lint`, and so on.

#### 4.1.1. Run jobs only with the 'lint' tag:

```bash
runem --tags lint
```

#### 4.1.2. If you want to lint all code _except_ nodejs code (and you have the appropriate tags):

```bash
runem --tags lint --not-tags deprecated
```

#### 4.1.3. Run fast checks on `pre-commit`

If you have fast jobs that tagged as appropriate for pre-commit hooks.

```bash
mkdir scripts/git-hooks
echo "runem --tags pre-commit" > scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit
# add the following to .git/config
# [core]
#   # ... existing config ...
#	  hooksPath = ./scripts/git-hooks/husky/
```

### 4.2. phase filters

Sometimes just want to run a specific phase, so you can focus on it and iterate quickly, within that context. 

#### 4.2.1 Focus on a phase

For example, if you have a `reformat` phase, you might want to run just `reformat` jobs phase whilst preparing a commit and are just preparing cosmetic changes e.g. updating comments, syntax, or docs.

```bash
runem --phase reformat
```

#### 4.2.2 Exclude slow phases temporarily

If you have 4 stages `bootstrap`, `pre-run`, `reformat`, `test` and `verify` phase, and are tightly iterating and focusing on the 'test-coverage' aspect of the test-phase, then you do not care about formatting as long as you can see your coverage results ASAP. However if your test-coverage starts passing then you will care about subsequent stages, so you can exclude the slower reformat-stage with the following and everything else will run.

```bash
runem --not-phase pre-run reformat
```

**Note:** The `--tags` and `--not-tags` options can be used in combination to further refine task execution based on your requirements.


## 5. Using Help to get an Overview of Your Jobs

The `--help` switch will show you a full list of all the configured job-tasks, the tags and the override options, describing how to configure a specific run.
```bash
$ python -m runem --help
#or
$ runem  --help
```

## 6. Configuration

`runem` searches for `.runem.yml` and will pre-load the command-line options with

Configuration is Yaml and consists of two main configurations, `config` and `job`:

- `config` describes how the jobs should be run.
- each `job`  entry describe a job-task, such and running unit-tests, linting or running any other type of command.

### 6.1. `config` - Run 'em global config

- **phases:** 
  - *Description:* Specifies the different phases of the testing process, in the order they are to be run. Each job will be run under a specific phase.
  - *Values:* A list of strings representing "phases" such as pre-run (e.g. bootstrapping), edit (running py-black or prettifier or clang-tools), and analysis (unit-tests, coverage, linting).

- **files:**
  - *Description:* Defines filters for categorizing files based on tags and regular expressions. Maps tags to files-to-be tested. If a job has one or more tags that map to file-filters that job will receive all files that match those filters.
  - *Values:* A list of dictionaries, each containing a 'filter' key with 'tag' and 'regex' subkeys.

- **options:**
  - *Description:* Configures various option-overrides for the job-tasks. Overrides can be set on the command line and accessed by jobs to turn on or off features such as 'check-only' or to opt out of sub-tasks.
  - *Values:* A list of dictionaries, each containing an 'option' key with 'default' boolean value, a 'name', a 'type', a 'desc', and optional 'alias' subkeys. NOTE: only 'bool' types are currently supported.

  - **default:** Specifies the default value of the option.
  - **name:** Represents the name of the option.
  - **type:** Indicates the data type of the option (e.g., bool for boolean).
  - **desc:** Provides a description of the option.
  - **alias:** (Optional) Provides an alias for the option if specified.

### 6.2. `job` - Job config
- **job:**
  - *Description:* Represents a specific job task that is to be run asynchronously.
  - *Fields:*
    - **addr:**
      - *Description:* Specifies the address details of the job, including the file and function.
      - *Subkeys:*
        - **file:** Indicates the file path of the job.
        - **function:** Indicates the function within the file that represents the job.
      - *Example:*
        ```yaml
        file: scripts/test-hooks/rust_wrappers.py
        function: _job_rust_code_reformat
        ```

    - **ctx:**
      - *Description:* Provides the execution context for the job, including the working directory and parameters.
      - *Subkeys:*
        - **cwd:** Specifies the working directory for the job.
        - **params:** Specifies parameters for the job.
      - *Example:*
        ```yaml
        cwd: .
        params:
          limitFilesToGroup: true
        ```

    - **label:**
      - *Description:* Assigns a label to the job for identification.
      - *Example:*
        ```yaml
        label: reformat py
        ```

    - **when:**
      - *Description:* Defines the conditions under which the job should run.
      - *Subkeys:*
        - **phase:** Specifies the testing phase in which the job should run.
        - **tags:** Specifies the tags associated with the job.
      - *Example:*
        ```yaml
        when:
          phase: edit
          tags:
            - py
            - format
        ```

  - *Example:*
    ```yaml
    - job:
        addr:
          file: scripts/test-hooks/nodejs.py
          function: _job_js_code_reformat
        ctx:
          cwd: src/subproject_4
          params:
            limitFilesToGroup: true
        label: reformat 
        when:
          phase: edit
          tags:
            - js
            - subproject4
            - pretty
