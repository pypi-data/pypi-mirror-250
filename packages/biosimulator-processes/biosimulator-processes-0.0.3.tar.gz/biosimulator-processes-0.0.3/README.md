# biosimulator-processes 


Core implementations of `process-bigraph.composite.Process()` aligning with BioSimulators simulator
tools.


## Getting Started (PyPI)

The easiest way to download this tool is via the Python Package Index. You may download
core-processes with: 

    pip install biosimulator-processes

We recommend using an environment/package manager [like Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) to 
install the dependencies required for your use.

 Most of the direct UI content for this tooling will be in the form of a jupyter notebook.

### Using `biosimulator_processes.smoldyn_process.SmoldynProcess()`: 

#### PLEASE NOTE: 
Due to the multi-lingual nature of Smoldyn, which is primarily 
developed in C++, the installation process for utilizing 
the `SmoldynProcess` process implementation requires separate handling. This is particularly 
relevant for macOS and Windows users, where setting up the Python bindings can be more complex.

Please follow the detailed installation instructions provided below to ensure proper setup 
of Smoldyn for your system.

1. Visit the [Smoldyn Download Page](https://www.smoldyn.org/download.html).
