## [6.11.0] - 2023-01-10
Happy new year everyone !
Some minor features and fixes in this version

### Added
- `Data.update_metadata()` can be called to update metadata of a data.
- `DatasetVersion.load_annotations()` can now be called with parameter `assets` to build a json coco file with only given assets.

### Fixed
- When downloading a file, there was a race condition when creating parent directories of downloaded file.
- Storing an artifact with `do_zip=True` was not creating expected archive name when a dot was present in filename.
- On upload, large file discriminant is now 25MiB and not 5MiB

### Changed

## [6.10.3] - 2023-09-22

### Fixed
- PredictionFormat will not raise an exception if one of its list is empty. `Deployment.monitor()` can now be called with empty predictions.

## [6.10.2] - 2023-09-06

### Fixed
- `Deployment.predict_bytes()` needs parameter `filename` to work. It was sending prediction with filename `media`.

## [6.10.1] - 2023-08-31

### Added

## [6.10.0] - 2023-08-21
Some deprecation on privacy object creation, it is not possible to create a public dataset, project or model from the sdk anymore.
Attach dataset version to Feedback Loop and Continuous Training settings of your deployments.

### Added
- `Deployment.attach_dataset_to_feedback_loop()` can now be called to attach a dataset to Feedback Loop settings of your deployment. Attached datasets can be filled with reviewed prediction from your deployment.
- `Deployment.detach_dataset_from_feedback_loop()` allows detaching dataset from Feedback Loop.
- `Deployment.list_feedback_loop_datasets()` will list attached datasets of your Feedback Loop.

- `Client.get_datalake()` can now be called with parameter `id` or `name` to retrieve the Datalake you want. If nothing is given, this method will retrieve your default datalake.

## [6.8.0] - 2023-06-12

### Added
- `Datalake.upload_data()` now accept parameter `metadata` which is a dict (or a list of dict if there are multiple filepaths) matching common metadata allowed by Picsellia.

Some changes on `monitor()` following an update of our monitoring stack.

### Added
- Property `type` of a deployment.
- Method `Deployment.monitor_bytes()` can be called if you have an image as bytes to send to monitoring.

### Changed

- Parameter `shadow_raw_predictions` of `Deployment.monitor()` will be replaced by parameter `shadow_prediction` in the future
- You can add `content_type` parameter to monitor() if you don't want sdk to infer it with mimetypes. It will be checked with common content types of the mimetypes library
- `content_type` of monitor_bytes() is mandatory and should be a SupportedContentType enum or string. Current common type supported are "image/png" and "image/jpeg"

## [6.7.0] - 2023-05-05

### Added

- `list_data` and `list_assets` have a new parameter `q` that can be used the same way the query language is used in the web platform
- Deployment has new methods: `set_training_data`, `check_training_data_metrics_status` and `disable_training_data_reference`, that can be used for monitoring and unsupervised metrics.
- `as_multidata` of MultiAsset can now be called with parameter
- Artifact, Data, Asset, LoggingFile, ScanFile, ModelFile are now inheriting from Downloadable, and have `url` property that can be used to download files. These urls are presigned and expired at some point in the future.

### Added
- Jobs are now handled differently in Picsellia platform
- `get_dataset_version_by_id` can be done in Client
- `get_model_version_by_id` can be done in Client
- `get_experiment_by_id` can be done in Client
- Import yolo files with `import_annotations_yolo_files`
- `upload_data` can be called with an ErrorManager to retrieve errors after upload.

### Fix
- Pascal VOC files parsing allows some fields to not be set
- 502 errors were not handled correctly
- Uploading images that were transposed now correctly send width and height on the platform

### Changed
- Downloading files has a new retry policy
- When importing YOLO, COCO or Pascal VOC files, you need to set type of dataset before.
- Some refactor on import annotations, it should be faster now !


## [6.4.2] - 2023-03-03

### Changed
- Return line after logging chapter
- Allow parameter `enforced_ordered_categories` on `build_coco_file_locally()` to enforce categories of built coco file.

### Fixed
- Do a paginated call in dataset version `train_test_split` when loading assets
- Method `set_type` of dataset version was failing when logging result if a string was given

## [6.4.1] - 2023-02-17

### Fix
- Some methods were using types not compatible with python older than 3.8

## [6.4.0] - 2023-02-16

### Added
- DatasetVersion `list_assets()` will call XGET method when filtering on filenames or object_names, to not have the limit size query error.

### Fix
- Datalake `upload_data()` now allow effectively a Datasource
- Import annotations was limited to 10 000 annotations because `find_assets()` was used. It is now using `list_assets()` which is paginated.

- Datalake `list_data()` can be used to filter on object_names.

### Fix
- `ModelVersion.store()` was not using `replace` parameter correctly, it will now delete existing model file if it exists

### Changed
- All `max_workers` parameters are now `None` by default, to use cpu count + 4 as default value
- Datalake `list_data()` will call XGET method when filtering on filenames or object_names, to not have the limit size query error.

### Removed
- `AnnotationStatus.REVIEWED` status was never really used and is now removed from Picsellia.


## [6.3.1] - 2023-01-20
This is a patch to fix download dataset on huge datasets

### Fix
- `as_multidata` now uses xget to retrieve all datas with given list of ids

### Changed
- `as_multidata` is not called in `download` from DatasetVersion

## [6.3.0] - 2023-01-19
Happy new year from the Picsellia Team !
This minor version add some useful methods and fix specified COCOFile format.

### Added
- List public models with `list_public_models()` from the Picsellia Hub in Client.
- Find public model with `find_public_model()` from the Picsellia Hub in Client.
- Convert MultiAsset into MultiData with `as_multidata()` and `as_list_of_data()`
- Allow asset tags to be added when adding data to a dataset with `add_data()`
- Method `__repr__` has been added to MultiObjects
- Property `labels` in ModelVersion objects
- Add `get_dataset` in ModelContext to get DatasetVersion from its attached name

### Fix
- **breaking**: COCOFile was wrongly specified: in annotations, only one segmentation was allowed for each shape,
but COCOFile allows multiple polygons. Now you need to give a list of list of coordinates instead of only one list of coordinates.
`import_annotations_coco_file()` should now work fine with COCO files with segmentation.
- Add AuthenticationError again in exceptions, which was used by picsellia-tf2

### Changed
- **may be breaking**: Default value of force_create_label is now True in `import_annotations_coco_file` and `import_annotation_voc_file`.
- Rename `retrieve_experiment` into `get_experiment` in ModelContext
- `retrieve_datasets` in ModelContext now return a dict with attached name as key and dataset version as value
- `download()` a DatasetVersion is not calling assets extended endpoints which was taking a lot of time on huge datasets.
- Imports order with pre-commit cln tool
- Doc generation with all properties docstring
