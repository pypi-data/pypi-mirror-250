Repository of a data modeling and analysis tool based on Bayesian networks

BAMT - Bayesian Analytical and Modelling Toolkit. This repository contains a data modeling and analysis tool based on Bayesian networks. It can be divided into two main parts - algorithms for constructing and training Bayesian networks on data and algorithms for applying Bayesian networks for filling gaps, generating synthetic data, assessing edges strength e.t.c.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

BAMT package is available via PyPi:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bamt

BAMT Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following algorithms for Bayesian Networks learning are implemented:


* Building the structure of a Bayesian network based on expert knowledge by directly specifying the structure of the network;
* Building the structure of a Bayesian network on data using three algorithms - Hill Climbing, evolutionary and PC (evolutionary and PC are currently under development). For Hill Climbing, the following score functions are implemented - MI, K2, BIC, AIC. The algorithms work on both discrete and mixed data.
* Learning the parameters of distributions in the nodes of the network based on Gaussian distribution and Mixture Gaussian distribution with automatic selection of the number of components.
* Non-parametric learning of distributions at nodes using classification and regression models.
* BigBraveBN - algorithm for structural learning of Bayesian networks with a large number of nodes. Tested on networks with up to 500 nodes.

Difference from existing implementations:


* Algorithms work on mixed data;
* Structural learning implements score-functions for mixed data;
* Parametric learning implements the use of a mixture of Gaussian distributions to approximate continuous distributions;
* Non-parametric learning of distributions with various user-specified regression and classification models;
* The algorithm for structural training of large Bayesian networks (> 10 nodes) is based on local training of small networks with their subsequent algorithmic connection.

For example, in terms of data analysis and modeling using Bayesian networks, a pipeline has been implemented to generate synthetic data by sampling from Bayesian networks.

How to use
^^^^^^^^^^

Then the necessary classes are imported from the library:

.. code-block:: python

   import bamt.networks as Nets

Next, a network instance is created and training (structure and parameters) is performed:

.. code-block:: python

   bn = Nets.HybridBN(has_logit=False, use_mixture=True)
   bn.add_edges(discretized_data, scoring_function=('K2',K2Score))
   bn.fit_parameters(data)

Project structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The latest stable version of the library is available in the master branch.

It includes the following modules and direcotries:

* `bamt <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/bamt>`__ - directory with the framework code:
    * Preprocessing - module for data preprocessing
    * Networks - module for building and training Bayesian networks
    * Nodes - module for nodes support of Bayesian networks
    * Utilities - module for mathematical and graph utilities
* `data <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/data>`__  - directory with data for experiments and tests
* `tests <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/tests>`__  - directory with unit and integration tests
* `tutorials <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/tutorials>`__  - directory with tutorials
* `docs <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT/tree/master/docs>`__ - directory with RTD documentation

Preprocessing
=============

Preprocessor module allows user to transform data according pipeline (similar to pipeline in scikit-learn).

Networks
========

Three types of networks are implemented:

* HybridBN - Bayesian network with mixed data
* DiscreteBN - Bayesian network with discrete data
* ContinuousBN - Bayesian network with continuous data

They are inherited from the abstract class BaseNetwork.

Nodes
=====

Contains classes for nodes of Bayesian networks.

Utilities
=========

Utilities module contains mathematical and graph utilities to support the main functionality of the library.
