# IP-Subnet-Trie
An efficient data structure for handling a large number of IP addresses/subnets in a hierarchy. 

### Run tests
```
pytest -s tests
```

### Generate Python protobuf classes from proto file.
```
cd ip_subnet_trie
protoc --python_out=. binary_trie.proto
```

### Example code
You can see example code in tests/ directory.

### Contribution
This project has the significant contribution of GitHub Copilot. It is my first project using an AI-assistance tool. Moreover, this is also the first project where I have uploaded a library to Pypi. I hope it will be useful to many people.
