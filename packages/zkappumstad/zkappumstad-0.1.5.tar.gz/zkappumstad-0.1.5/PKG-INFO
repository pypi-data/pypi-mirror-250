## Best Practices for Asking Questions

1. **Be Specific:** Clearly state your issue or the topic you need assistance with.

2. **Querying issues, errors, problems:** Begin with "I have an issue ..." or "I have a problem ..." for asking about errors, issues, problems, discussion, strange questions etc in order to utilize Issue Tool which queries the Issue Vectors which includes Discord and Github data.

3. **Do not extend the conversation:** Even though `gpt-4-1106-preview` can handle overlong contexts, it is strongly advised that not to extend the conversation too much(For now, ideal 3 questions). Just create new chat after 2-3 questions because every query creates crowded context.
