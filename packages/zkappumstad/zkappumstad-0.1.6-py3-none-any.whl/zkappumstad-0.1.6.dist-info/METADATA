# zkApp Umstad CLI Agent

## Introduction

Introducing the zkApps Umstad AI Agent, your specialized assistant in the realm of the MINA Protocol and o1js. This agent, powered by the advanced GPT language model, is tailored to support developers in creating, debugging and testing zkApps smart contracts. It offers comprehensive guidance and expertise specifically for those working on zkApps development within the MINA ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
pip install zkappumstad
```

It is suggested that before using the tool create a folder and use it inside the folder.

```bash
mkdir new_folder
cd new_folder
```

Create zk project and wait 10-15 seconds:
```bash
zkumstad-create
```

Go into the zkapps project folder and you can optionally open the project in editor:
```bash
cd initial_project
code .
```

Then, you can run and use the tool:
```bash
zkumstad-start
```

## Features & Architecture
Currently uses our own API to send queries. No need to post your OPENAI API KEY. However, it will be needed to POST the query with OPENAI API KEY later on.

#### Retrieval Tools
- Documentations
- Code Snippets
- Projects
- Issues

#### Coder Agent
- Gets related context and writes code
- Builds and gets errors
- Debugs errors
- Fix and retry code

## Usage
#### Commands
- ```zkumstad-start```: Runs the tool.
- ```zkumstad-create```: Initialize zkapps project named initial_project.
- You can save your conversations by writing 'save' to console as a Markdown file.
- You can reset the conversation by writing 'reset'.
- Write 'quit' to terminate the agent.

#### Specifications
- You Must Delete smart contract and test files from src folder before creating new contract in order to build.

### Best Practices for Agent
- Specify your project requirements in detail and collaborate with the AI Agent.
- In order to query about issues, errors etc. start with "I have an issue...".
