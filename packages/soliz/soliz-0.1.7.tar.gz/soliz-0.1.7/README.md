# Soliz - A lexer creation tool

## Features

- Provides basic implementations for: strings, integers, floats, operators, symbols
- Soliz's abstract design allows quick and easily understandable development
- Pretty error printing

### Errors look like:

```
Error: Unexpected character
{"key": 4.4.}
           ^
Expected: 'digit', found '.'
Occurs at: 1:12-12
```

<sub>WARNING: Order of the rules may matter depending on the implementation.</sub>
