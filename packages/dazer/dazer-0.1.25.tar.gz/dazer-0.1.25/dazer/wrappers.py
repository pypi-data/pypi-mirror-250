    """
     Iteratively subsamples a data frame to test data. The subsample is done by randomly choosing a subset of columns from the data frame and then re - sampling the data with a variety of random numbers.
     
     Args:
     	 df: Data frame to be subsampled.
     	 columns_keep_ratio: List of column names to keep ratio is ignored.
     	 allowed_deviation: Allowed deviation is used to determine the probability of a column being considered to be significant.
     	 test_size: Number of samples to be tested.
     	 random_states: List of random numbers to use for the subsampling.
     	 attempts: Number of attempts to subsample before giving up.
     	 ratios: Numpy array of ratios to use for each subsample.
     
     Returns: 
     	 Two dicts with DataFrame values, the first one containing test data and the second one training data. The keys containg information about ratios and random seeds. If there is an error in the data a ValueError is raised
