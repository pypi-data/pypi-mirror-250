## Introduction

https://pypi.org/project/sequentiality/0.0.1/

Sequentiality is a Python package designed for extracting key features from a list of integers. It specializes in identifying various forms of Longest Consecutive Subsequences (LCS) within an integer list. This functionality is crucial for data analysis, statistical assessments, and algorithmic processing in numerous fields.

## Installation & Importing

```python
pip install sequentiality
```

```python
from Sequentiality import Sequentiality
```

## Features & Usage

Sequentiality provides methods for the following feature extraction capabilities:

1. **find_LongestConseqSubseq**: Finds the Longest Consecutive Subsequence of integers in the list.
2. **find_LongestConseqSubseq_1gap**: Identifies the LCS with one gap allowed.
3. **find_LongestConseqSubseq_2gap**: Extracts the LCS allowing two gaps (only once between them).
4. **find_LongestConseqSubseq_from_end**: Determines the LCS counted from the end of the list.
5. **find_LongestConseqSubseq_from_end_with_1_gap**: LCS from the end with one gap allowed (only once).
6. **find_LongestConseqSubseq_from_end_with_2_gap**: LCS from the end with two gaps allowed (specific conditions apply).

Additional utility methods:

- **find_sequential_elements_with_difference_of_2**: Finds pairs in the sequence with a difference of 2.
- **find_sequential_elements_with_difference_of_3**: Finds pairs in the sequence with a difference of 3.


```python
seq = Sequentiality()
sample = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16]
print(seq.find_LongestConseqSubseq(sample))
print(seq.find_LongestConseqSubseq_1gap(sample))
print(seq.find_LongestConseqSubseq_2gap(sample))
print(seq.find_LongestConseqSubseq_from_end(sample))
print(seq.find_LongestConseqSubseq_from_end_with_1_gap(sample))
print(seq.find_LongestConseqSubseq_from_end_with_2_gap(sample))
```
