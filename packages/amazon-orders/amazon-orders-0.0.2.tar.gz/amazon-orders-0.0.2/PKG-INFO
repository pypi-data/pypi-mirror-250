# Amazon Orders

`amazon-orders` is an unofficial library that provides a command line interface alongside a programmatic API that can
be used to interact with Amazon.com's consumer-facing website.

This package works by parsing website data from Amazon.com. A nightly build validates this functionality to ensure its
stability, but as it is not officially supported, it may break at any time.

## Installation

`amazon-orders` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/amazon-orders/) and can be installed using `pip`:

```sh
pip install amazon-orders
```

That's it! `amazon-orders` is now available as a Python package is available from the command line.

## Basic Usage

Execute `amazon-orders` from the command line with:

```sh
amazon-orders --username <AMAZON_EMAIL> --password <AMAZON_PASSWORD>
```

Or use `amazon-orders` programmatically:

```python
from amazonorders.session import AmazonSession
from amazonorders.page.orderhistory import OrderHistory

amazon_session = AmazonSession("AMAZON_EMAIL", "AMAZON_PASSWORD")
amazon_session.login()

order_history = OrderHistory(amazon_session, year=2023)
order_history.get_orders()
```

`amazon-orders` is under active development, and at present does very little. The first goal is to be able to fetch a
customer's Orders page so order and return data, alongside payment information, can be gathered. Depending on the
success of that functionality, additional features may be added as well for browsing Amazon as a whole (the library
would probably be renamed at that point).
