        The functionality is as follows:
        1. Parse the provided command line (argv) into args (dict[Arg]) and apps (list[App]).
        2. If "-h, --help" is encountered, display the help message and exit with code 0.

        5. Exit with code 0 if there are no issues.

         * All arguments are aligned section-wise. Their help texts are properly padded.
         * An argument and its help text are always on the same line, no matter how wide the argument is.

        Parameters:
         * argv - A raw command line as list[str]. Effectively defaults to sys.argv, if None.
