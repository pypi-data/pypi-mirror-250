    A Microsoft Graph API operator which allows you to execute an expression on the msgraph_sdk client.

    https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python

    :param expression: The expression being executed on the msgraph_sdk client (templated).
    :param conn_id: The HTTP Connection ID to run the operator against (templated).
    :param trigger_dag_id: The DAG ID to be triggered on each event (templated).
    :param timeout: The HTTP timeout being used by the msgraph_sdk client (default is None).
        When no timeout is specified or set to None then no HTTP timeout is applied on each request.
    :param proxies: A Dict defining the HTTP proxies to be used (default is None).
    :param api_version: The API version of the msgraph_sdk client to be used (default is v1).
        You can pass an enum named APIVersion which has 2 possible members v1 and beta,
        or you can pass a string which equals the enum values as "v1.0" or "beta".
        This will determine which msgraph_sdk client is going to be used as each version has a dedicated client.
    :param keep_events: A boolean which determines if the operator keeps track of the triggered events (default False).
        If set to true, the aggregated events will be returned once the operator has finished executing.
