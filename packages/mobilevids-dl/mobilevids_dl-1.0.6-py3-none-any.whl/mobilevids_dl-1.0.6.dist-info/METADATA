# Introduction

[Mobilevids][1] is an amazing website for downloading movies and tv shows.

This script makes it easier to batch download movies or TV serials.

Why is this helpful?  A utility like [wget][2] can work, but has the
following limitations:

1. Video names have numbers in them, but this does not correspond to
    the actual order.  Manually renaming them is a pain that is best left
    for computers.
2. Using names from the syllabus page provides more informative names.
3. Using `wget` in a for loop picks up extra videos which are not
    posted/linked, and these are sometimes duplicates.

This work was originally inspired in part by [coursera-dl][3].


# Features
  * Support for all kinds of movies / TV shows.
  * Intentionally detailed names, so that it will display and sort properly
    on most interfaces (e.g., [VLC][4] or MX Video on Android devices).
  * Login credentials accepted on command-line or from `.netrc` file.
  * Core functionality tested on Linux, Mac and Windows.


# Installation instructions

`mobilevids-dl` requires Python 3 and a free Mobilevids account.

**Note:** We *strongly* recommend that you use a Python 3 interpreter (3.9
or later).

On any operating system, ensure that the Python executable location is added
to your `PATH` environment variable and, once you have the dependencies
installed (see next section), for a *basic* usage, you will need to invoke
the script from the main directory of the project and prepend it with the
word `python`.  You can also use more advanced features of the program by
looking at the "Running the script" section of this document.


## Recommended installation method for all Operating Systems

From a command line (preferably, from a virtual environment), simply issue
the command:

    pip install mobilevids-dl


This will download [the latest released version][7] of the program from the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)][6] along with *all* the necessary
dependencies. At this point, you should be ready to start using it.

If this does not work, because your Python 2 version is too old (e.g. 2.7.5
on Ubuntu 14.4), try:

    apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install mobilevids-dl

instead.

**Note 1:** We strongly recommend that you *don't* install the package
globally on your machine (i.e., with root/administrator privileges), as the
installed modules may conflict with other Python applications that you have
installed in your system (or they can interfere with `mobilevids-dl`).  Prefer
to use the option `--user` to `pip install`, if you can.

**Note 2:** As already mentioned, we *strongly* recommend that you use a new
Python 3 interpreter (e.g., 3.9 or later), since Python 3 has better support
for SSL/TLS (for secure connections) than earlier versions.<br/>


# Running the script

Refer to `mobilevids-dl --help` for a complete, up-to-date reference on the runtime options
supported by this utility.

```bash
usage: mobilevids-dl [-h] [-a] [-d] [-i] [-e EPISODE] [-m MOVIE] [-p PASSWORD] [-s SEASON] [-t TV]
                     [-u USERNAME]
                     [search]

Mobilevids Downloader script

positional arguments:
  search

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --ascii           show ascii art
  -d, --debug           debugs the program - duh
  -i, --info            show info about movie/show
  -e EPISODE, --episode EPISODE
                        download a single episode (must be used with -t [TV ID] and -s [SEASON]
  -m MOVIE, --movie MOVIE
                        downloads the ID of a movie
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        provide a mobilevids password
  -s SEASON, --season SEASON
                        specify season to download (must use with -t)
  -t TV, --tv TV        download a TV show based on it's ID
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        provide a mobilevids username
```

Run the script to download the media by providing your mobilevids account
credentials (e.g. email address and password or a `~/.netrc` file), the
movie name, as well as any additional parameters:

On \*nix platforms, the use of a `~/.netrc` file is a good alternative to
specifying both your username (i.e., your email address) and password every
time on the command line. To use it, simply add a line like the one below to
a file named `.netrc` in your home directory (or the [equivalent][5], if you
are using Windows) with contents like:
```
    machine mobilevids-dl login <user> password <pass>
```
Create the file if it doesn't exist yet.  From then on, you can switch from
using `-u` and `-p` to simply call `mobilevids-dl`.
This is especially convenient, as typing usernames (email
addresses) and passwords directly on the command line can get tiresome (even
more if you happened to choose a "strong" password).

# Reporting issues
